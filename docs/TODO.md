# TODO

## Housekeeping
- [ ] Postgres/eslint dev-tooling audit warnings (PostCSS via eslint-config-next) — transitive, dev-only, not runtime-exploitable; revisit when upgrading to Next 15/16 (breaking change, not done now).
- [ ] Wire a real deploy step into `.github/workflows/release.yml` (staging on `develop`, production on the `v*` tag) once Vercel + Neon are provisioned — see `docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md` and ADR-0008. Deploy target only, the branching/tagging automation around it is already in place.

## Still to grill (architecture/design/decisions not yet interviewed)
- [ ] Multi-admin/staff invite flow — access-control seam exists (ADR-0005: `admin` role, per-use-case checks), but the actual invite/onboarding UX and any role subdivision (staff vs. owner) isn't designed yet.

- [ ] Stripe integration for card/Apple Pay payments — build behind a feature toggle (off by default until ready to enable in production). Zelle/Cash manual confirmation (ADR-0002) works independently and is not gated by this toggle.
- [ ] SMS notifications (Twilio or equivalent) — build the adapter now, gate actual sending behind a feature toggle (off by default) until there's budget to pay for real sending. See ADR-0009. Email (Resend) covers all required notification events in the meantime.
- [ ] Customer data import — a dedicated admin-only screen/flow to import existing customer records, format TBD. Not an MVP-launch blocker; build once the source format is confirmed.
- [ ] Mail-in label generation via a third-party carrier API (e.g. Shippo/EasyPost) — behind the same adapter pattern as address validation. Not in MVP; MVP only captures/validates the shipping address (ADR-0010).
- [ ] Standalone cross-order messages inbox screen — behind a feature toggle. MVP messaging lives inside Item detail only; the inbox is a post-MVP admin screen.
